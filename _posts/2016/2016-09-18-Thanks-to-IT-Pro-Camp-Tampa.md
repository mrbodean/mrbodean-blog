Thanks to IT Pro Camp Tampa for having me as a [speaker](http://camp30.itprocamp.com/speaker/jonathan-warnken/) on August 20, 2016.  I enjoyed meeting all of the other speakers . I was truly surprised at the size of my audience, because Santos Martinez (The Config Ninja) was speaking at the same time.

Also saw the HoloLens in person and was able to give it a spin.
