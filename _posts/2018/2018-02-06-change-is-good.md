I know the blog has been silent for a bit but there have been a lot of things happening personally and professionally. The biggest being that I am now working as a Microsoft PFE for SCCM. I started on February 5th and it has been a fantastic 2 days. Hopefully all the future days continue to be the same. I am not sure how this will impact my blogging but I will continue it just may be part of the pfe blogs.
