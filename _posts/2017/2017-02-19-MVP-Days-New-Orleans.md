Come join me at [MVP Days New Orleans on May 12, 2017<span style="color: #b00218;">.</span>](http://www.mvpdays.com/?page_id=7181) I have submitted to speak and will hopefully be presenting. But after attending the Orlando MVP day in 2016, I decided to attend every one of these that I can work into my schedule. So regardless of out come of my sessions submission, I will be there. The biggest reason is the time that is set aside for interaction with all of the speakers at the end of the day. This unstructured session allows you to ask questions and network with everyone. That is hands down worth your time. So if you are able register and take part in a great community event.
