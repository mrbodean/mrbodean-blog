MVP Mick Pletcher is organizing a PowerShell Saturday event for Nashville. It is still in the planning stages but I will be there. Once the details are finalized I will share them. Hopefully if you are in the area you can join in on the fun. These events are a great way to learn and interact will MVPs and others passionate about using PowerShell. The planned date is for Saturday June 24, 2017.  I will be speaking on Powershell for SCCM.
